It sounds like you’ve found a really effective, systematic way to use AI as a personal nutrition coach! Writing this out for Natalie is a great idea—it makes the process feel much less intimidating.

Here is a clear, step-by-step explanation of your method that you can share with her.

How I Built My Custom Bodybuilding Diet Using AI
To get a diet that actually works for my body and my schedule, I used ChatGPT as a specialized nutritionist. Instead of just asking for a "random meal plan," I gave it a specific set of data points so it could tailor everything to my exact needs.

Step 1: Providing the "Body Stats"
First, I gave the AI my physical baseline. This allows the AI to calculate my Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)—the calories my body burns just by existing.

Age, Height, and Weight: This determines the starting calorie count.

Daily Activity Level: I explained what I do for work (whether I’m sitting at a desk or on my feet all day).

Training Frequency: I told it I train 5 days a week for 45 minutes per session.

Step 2: Defining the Goal
I was very specific about the outcome. I told the AI I wanted a "Body Recomposition" plan—which means I want to build muscle and burn fat at the same time. This tells the AI to keep protein high while being precise with carbohydrates and fats.

Step 3: Setting the Food "Boundaries"
A diet only works if you actually enjoy the food. I gave the AI a list of my preferences:

Preferred Foods: I listed the fruits and proteins I actually like eating.

Flexibility: I asked the AI to design the plan around my list but gave it permission to "add a few extra bits" (like healthy fats or specific grains) to ensure I was hitting all my micronutrient and fiber goals.

Step 4: The Result
The AI then generated a full daily meal structure that told me exactly what to eat, when to eat it, and why those foods were chosen for my 5-day training split.

Why this works for bodybuilding:
"By giving the AI your specific workout duration (45 mins) and frequency (5 days), it ensures you aren't under-eating, which would cause muscle loss, or over-eating, which would add body fat. It’s a data-driven approach to eating."

Would you like me to help you draft the specific prompt Natalie should use to get her own plan started?
